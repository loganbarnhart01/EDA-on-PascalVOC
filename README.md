## EDA on PascalVOC

While learning about early object detection models I was introduced to the PascalVOC dataset. The dataset was originally compiled in 2007, so still the early days of object detection. When we get to visualizing the bounding boxes we can see how far object detection has come!

* `BW_Report_6.ipynb` is the notebook containing the EDA.
